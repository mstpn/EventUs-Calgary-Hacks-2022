# EventUs

EventUs is an anti-social media platform that breaks down the barriers to participation in online and in-person events in your area.

## What Roadblocks do people have when it comes to mental or physical health?

### First Roadblock
In light of Covid isolation it has become increasingly obvious of the need to be involved in some form of social interaction whether physical or mentally stimulating.

_Our Solution:_ <br>
It makes it easier to connect with people in your local communities that have similar interests. 

### Second Roadblock
Existing social media platforms create unhealthy ego centric user experiences that focus on friend list sizes and like counts. 

_Our Solution:_ <br>
EventUs addresses this issue by precluding direct user-to-user interactions. There is no user search or profile viewing capability. Instead it focuses on group chats that occur within each event.

### Third Roadblock
Individuals who enjoy group activities but are not extraverted can often struggle to bridge the initial anxiety of meeting new people.

_Our Solution:_ <br>
It is estimated that the entire human population is within six degrees of separation of familial relations.  We attempt to use this estimation to bridge the anxiety of meeting new people.  Each event includes a count of how many attendees the user has met before.  Future iterations could incorporate another count of acquaintances of acquaintances, eventually bridging those six degrees of separation.
