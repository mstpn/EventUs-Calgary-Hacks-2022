## What Roadblocks do people have when it comes to mental or physical health?

### First Roadblock
In light of Covid isolation it has become increasingly obvious of the need to be involved in some form of social interaction whether physical or mentally stimulating.

_Our Solution:_ <br>
It makes it easier to connect with people in your local communities that have similar interests. 

### Second Roadblock
Existing social media platforms create unhealthy ego centric user experiences that focus on friend list sizes and like counts. 

_Our Solution:_ <br>
EventUs addresses this issue by precluding direct user-to-user interactions. There is no user search or profile viewing capability. Instead it focuses on group chats that occur within each event.

### Third Roadblock
Individuals who enjoy group activities but are not extraverted can often struggle to bridge the initial anxiety of meeting new people.

_Our Solution:_ <br>
It is estimated that the entire human population is within six degrees of separation of familial relations.  We attempt to use this estimation to bridge the anxiety of meeting new people.  Each event includes a count of how many attendees the user has met before.  Future iterations could incorporate another count of acquaintances of acquaintances, eventually bridging those six degrees of separation.


## How we built it
We used Android Studio with Java to create an Android app. We integrated Firebase as the backend data solution to sync our users data and events with a real time database.

## Challenges we ran into
We have Java experience, but 0 in Android Development or in Front End in general. We never used Firebase either.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we actually did get a working prototype of our app. We got Firebase connected and were able to transfer data back and forth to the cloud.

## What we learned
Don't try a new system in a 24h hackathon. As none of us had front end experience, we should have taken more time before the event to make a basic app and not rely on Java skills to translate 1-1.

## What's next for Eventus
We all want to continue to flesh out the app, make the functionalities work, and deploy it to the app store. We may seek funding through our MRU innovation lab to help us in this goal.
